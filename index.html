            <p class="intro">Hi! I'm Alla Dankanych </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="group">
              <div class="item">
                <p>I was born in Russia and moved with my family to America when I was only 4 years old. We lived in Denver, Colorado for 16 years, before my family moved to North Port, Florida. That is where I met my husband. Recently, my husband and I moved to Lexington, Kentucky.</p>
                <p>In my free time I love to put puzzles together. Unlike most people, I find the challenge of a puzzle relaxing. If it's not a puzzle, it will be sudoko, or any other activity that has my brain working. If you're looking to hire a new software engineer to your team, please reach out! I am excited to work with others to build great software.</p>
                <p>I came across coding while I was working on a course for my Bachelors Accounting. I found that it was something that sparked my interest. A challenge I had not yet faced. A few years later, I decided it was time to purse something I had been thinking about since that course. As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software engineer. I am excited about this new journey of my life. </p>
